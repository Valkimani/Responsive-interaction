# Responsive-interaction

This is a refactor coding project. The codebase follows accessibility standards
making it optimized for search engines. The existing code has been restructured to make it more accessible without changing the external behavior. As a result, the code is easier to read while preserving its functionality.

To achive this, semantic elements like Aside,Footer,Header, Main and Nav were used to replace the Div elements. These are more descriptive at representing data. Other resaons for using semanitc elements were;

1. Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings
2. Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page
3. Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching though endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classes
4. Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated
5. Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming.

To make the CSS more efficient, CSS selectors and properties were integrated to follow the semantic structure of the html elements. Comments have been included before each element or section of the page explaining the changes.

For the images, an alt attribute was added with an accessible name.

The title describes a website that provides an improved,responsive user friendly search.
