# Responsive-interaction

<!--Added a description of the refactor project.-->

This is a refactor coding project. The codebase follows accessibility standards
making it optimizable for search engines. The existing code has been restructured to make it more accessible without changing the external behavior. As a result, the code is easier to read while preserving its functionality.

To achive this, semantic elements like Aside,Footer,Header, Main and Nav were used to replace the Div elements. These are more descriptive at representing data. Other resaons for using semanitc elements were;

For the client

1. The use of semantic elemnts will enable Search engines to consider its contents as important keywords. This will influence the page's search rankings.
2. Contrast has been utilized in the Header using different colors. This is helpful while helping visually impaired users navigate the page.

For a fellow developer

1. The semantic elements suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated.
2. IUsing semantic is more effecient because developers can find meaningful code in less time than searching though endless divs with .

To make the CSS more efficient, CSS selectors and properties were integrated to follow the semantic structure of the html elements. Comments have been included before each element or section of the page explaining the changes.

For the images, an alt attribute was added with an accessible name.

The title describes a website that provides an improved,responsive user friendly search.
